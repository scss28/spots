**spots** or "_some pixels on the screen_" is an OpenGL renderer written in

that!

### Features

- Text rendering.
- Instanced rendering (many quads per draw call).
- Render targets. 

## Examples
Run an example with `zig build run-spinning_quad` (to run a different example
replace "spinning_quad" with an example name).
